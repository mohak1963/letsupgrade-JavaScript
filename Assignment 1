Ques2.Write the difference between var, let and const with code examples.
1.var:it is function scoped. It is used to declare a variable.
If a variable is declared for a particular function using var we can access it outside the function also.
It defines data type as string.
Eg. var a=1
    Console.log(typeof a); op is string
2.let: it is block scoped used to declare a variable ie we can't access the variable outside the block.
It defines the datatype according to the value of the variable.
Eg. Let a=1
  console.log(typeof a); op is number
Variables are temporary memory locations and we can change the values
3. Const: it is for declaring a constant whose value will not change.
Constants's value cannot be changed.
Eg. const a=1;
